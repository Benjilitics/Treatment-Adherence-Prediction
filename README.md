# Treatment Adherence Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict patient treatment adherence based on various demographic, behavioral, clinical, and psychological factors. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to identify the most effective predictive model.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Visual Studio Code
- Git

## Project Setup

### 1. Install Required Software
- **Python**: Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Download and install from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Git**: Download and install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### 2. Set Up the Project Environment
1. Create a project folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir treatment_adherence_project
   cd treatment_adherence_project


Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv


Activate the virtual environment:

Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Alternatively, create a requirements.txt file with these libraries and run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure VS Code
Open VS Code and install the Python extension.
Open the project folder in VS Code.
Select the Python interpreter from the virtual environment.
Enable linting and formatting (optional).

Data Description

The dataset includes the following features:

Demographic factors: Age, Gender, Income_Level
Behavioral factors: Missed_Appointments, Refill_Gaps
Clinical factors: Side_Effects_Severity, Comorbidities, Polypharmacy
Psychological factors: Health_Literacy, Mental_Health_Status
System-related factors: Medication_Cost, Provider_Communication, Social_Support
Target variable: Adherence (1=Adherent, 0=Non-Adherent)
Analysis Workflow

The adherence_analysis.py script performs the following steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Load the dataset and examine basic statistics
Visualize the distribution of the target variable
Analyze relationships between features
2. Feature Engineering
Convert categorical variables to dummy variables
Scale numeric features
Create interaction terms (if applicable)
3. Feature Selection
Analyze feature correlations
Identify important features using Random Forest
4. Model Training and Evaluation
Split data into training and testing sets
Train multiple models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Evaluate models using:
Cross-validation
Accuracy
Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
ROC-AUC score
ROC curves
5. Model Comparison and Selection
Compare model performance metrics
Select the optimal model based on accuracy and ROC-AUC
Git Repository Management
Setting Up Git Repository
Method 1: Using Terminal

Initialize Git repository:

git init


Create a .gitignore file:

# Ignore virtual environment
venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
.DS_Store


Stage and commit files:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add treatment adherence analysis script"


Link to GitHub repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/treatment-adherence-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Method 2: Using VS Code Interface
Open the Source Control view in VS Code (Ctrl + Shift + G).
Click "Initialize Repository" if Git is not initialized.
Sign in to GitHub through VS Code.
Stage changes by clicking the "+" icon next to files.
Enter a commit message and click the checkmark icon to commit.
Click "Publish to GitHub" to create a new repository.
Choose public or private repository and click "Publish Repository".
Managing Git Repository
Stage changes: Use the "+" icon in the Source Control view.
Commit changes: Enter a message and click the checkmark.
Push changes: Click the "..." menu and select "Push".
Pull changes: Click the "..." menu and select "Pull".
Sync changes: Click the "Sync Changes" button.
Troubleshooting
Too Many Active Changes in Git

If you encounter the error "The git repository has too many active changes, only a subset of Git features will be enabled":

Create or update your .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files:

# Ignore virtual environment
venv/
.env/

# Ignore Python cache files
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo

# Ignore system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Ignore temporary files
*.log
*.tmp

# Ignore OneDrive files (if applicable)
.~lock.*
*.lnk


Remove tracked files that should be ignored:

git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "Clean up repository by ignoring unnecessary files"


If working in OneDrive, consider moving the project to a local directory to avoid conflicts.

Virtual Environment Issues
If the virtual environment is not recognized in VS Code, ensure you've selected the correct Python interpreter.
If libraries are not found, verify that the virtual environment is activated and libraries are installed.
Running the Analysis
Ensure the virtual environment is activated.
Run the script:
python adherence_analysis.py

Review the output, including plots and model performance metrics.

This project was created to demonstrate machine learning techniques for predicting patient treatment adherence.
